# Want to contribute?

Right now, there isn't a precise list of to-do, you might get some ideas by checking projects, or develop something and submit a PR.
As long as it's working a minimum, that's fine.

Take a look at existing code to figure out the syntax style (mostly is standard JS/TS standard).

I prefer tabs to spaces but it's not a problem if there are inconsistencies between files (but not in the same file).
